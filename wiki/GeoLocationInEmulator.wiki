In order to center map on current location while you're testing MapMe in the Android emulator you'll have to manually pass a location via telnet, eg:

   telnet localhost 5554
   geo fix -122.08 37.41

(or, alternatively, code a mock location provider (more info here: http://androidcommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55))

However, there's a bug in Android that prevents geo fix to work properly with the emulator.
