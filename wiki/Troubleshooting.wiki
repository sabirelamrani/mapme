This demo will show a blank map if you don't provide your own Android Maps API key.

The procedure to generate it is described here:
http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/location/geo/mapkey.html

Once you get your API key edit the following file:

res/layout/mapview.xml

and replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your generated key.

The key must be generated using the same fingerprint in your Eclipse Android debug store
