MapMe basically mimics Google Maps functionality but adds storage of location bookmarks/navpoints (including local search capabilities) via db4o.

This is a demo to show you how db4o can provide local persistence in a straight forward fully object oriented way for your Android applications.

Why db4o is cooler than SQLite? As you provide upgrades to your app you'll notice that db4o evolves the schema transparently: your users will still be able to see previously stored locations even after you enhance your domain objects.

Enter Transparent upgrades for Android!!! =D
