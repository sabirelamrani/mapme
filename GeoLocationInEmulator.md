In order to center map on current location while you're testing MapMe in the Android emulator you'll have to do one of the following:

a) Manually pass a location via telnet, eg:

> telnet localhost 5554

> geo fix -122.08 37.41

However, there's a bug in Android that prevents geo fix to work properly with the emulator.
See: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1701

b) Select Window>>Open Perspective>>DDMS (You may have to click other and browse for it, if it isnâ€™t there). Under the Emulator Control tab scroll down until you see the Location Controls. This control allows you to push one location or a series of locations in GPX or KML format. Enter the latitude and longitude into the box and click send. This will simulate a GPS location coming into the device.

c) Code a mock location provider (more info here: http://androidcommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55)
